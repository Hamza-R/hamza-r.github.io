      <p>I'm currently in my first year. I first began coding at the end of 2017
        during my A Levels.I learnt to code in python,with a heavy focus on OOP
        and I ended up coding a version of space invaders with a slight twist. </p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Ball Chasing Game</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at
	City (2020). This Processing project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding
	of the use of loops,groups and arrays. I created seperate classes for all my entities,
  my player and enemy balls which stored their basic characterisitscs such as size,
  speed and starting coordinates. Although for the enemy balls I used random to decide where
  they would initially appear on the screen. The aim of the game is to eat all the balls as quickly
  as you can. However at the end I was unable to find a way to remove a ball from the enemy ball array
  after it collided with the player.
